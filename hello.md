What I want to take from this class?
As a computer engineer I enjoy working with computers rather it is repairing hardware and writing a software. By taking this class I 
hope to exapnd my computer programming skills in C. In possible, I would like to start a network of computer engineers and computer
science majors to share and collabrate our ideas together. :smiley:
